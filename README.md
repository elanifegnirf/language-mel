# MEL language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting to
[MEL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Embedded_Language) files in
[Atom](https://atom.io/).

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [MEL TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/mel.tmbundle.git).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
